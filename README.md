# ðŸŽ© Welcome!

Welcome to the **Wake Forest Majors Wiki**! The Wake Forest Majors Wiki is devoted to providing helpful information and useful materials for all Demon Deacons, including information about majors, course evaluations, and specific materials and websites related to different majors and courses. Our goal is to use this platform to share our understanding and experiences of various majors with future students, helping them to choose majors and navigate courses more easily than we did."

This wiki platform is created by AppDev and based on GitBook, a platform for building and hosting online books and documentation. AppDev, a computer science interest club at Wake made up of 6 students, is not affiliate with Wake Forest University. AppDev created this wiki platform to share what we know with others, and not for any financial returns.

This wiki platform is designed to help students choose majors and courses easily and may provide some class materials in the past. Students should neither copy the work from those materials nor refer to them when doing their own work. Such behvaiors may violate the honor code of Wake Forest University (refer to it below), and we don't recommend people to do this. AppDev and the platform are not responsible for any consequence caused by such behaviors.

With that being said, let's show you how to use the wiki:

<summary>How to use it?</summary>

1. On the left, you can find the sidebar showing all the majors we have so far. Scroll it and click the majors you are interested in.
2. There are several pages under every major. Every page contains different kinds of information about the major you selected. We recommend you to read the pages in sequence to have a comprehensive understanding of a major and its required courses.
